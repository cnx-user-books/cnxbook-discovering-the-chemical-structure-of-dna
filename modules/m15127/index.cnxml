    <para id="delete_me">Watson and Crick’s <link document="m15126" target-id="element-814">hypothetical macromolecular structure</link> for DNA also had significant mechanistic implications for solidifying DNA’s role in heredity. As <link url="http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/archive.html">Watson and Crick </link>(1953, p. 737) wrote, <cite><cite-title>“It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for genetic material.”</cite-title></cite>
      
    </para><para id="element-520">Consider this final point.  </para><para id="element-225">1. Watson and Crick have just proposed a hypothetical structure that, as they write, <cite><cite-title>‘rests mainly though not entirely on published experimental data and stereochemical arguments’</cite-title></cite> (<link url="http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/archive.html">Watson and Crick</link>, 1953, p.737). Why is it so important that this structure suggests a mechanism for copying the DNA molecule? Please explain.</para><para id="element-415">2. Take a look at the <link document="m15126" target-id="element-419">structure of this molecule</link>. Offer a hypothetical mechanism by which a DNA molecule might be copied (replicated).  </para><para id="element-428">3. Describe a way you could experimentally test your model. As you do this make sure to include a) an hypothesis statement based on your model b) what results you expect if your model is correct and c) what results you expect if your model is incorrect.  </para><list id="element-959" list-type="bulleted"><title>Works Cited</title>
